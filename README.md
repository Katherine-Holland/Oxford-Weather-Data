## Introduction

**User:**


## Design
The wireframe was created using Balsamiq. 

## Features
Below are the core functions and elements I incorporated into the site.

### Functions

### Main script
I created a simple quiz for children who wanted to learn more about snails. This game is followed by a link to the Natural History Museum's guide to snails, allowing the audience to find out more from an established authority on Natural History. 
This quiz was created around a similar code structure to the Code Institute tutorial 'Rock , Paper, Scissors', using an array and a scoring system based on the correct answer being chosen.

### Refactoring

## Deployment
I deployed the site via Heroku. 
When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.


## Manual Testing
1. I tested it using two popular browsers, Chrome and Firefox, both of which worked as expected.
